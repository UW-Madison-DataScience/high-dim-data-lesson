    "- T/F tests: https://randomeffect.net/post/2020/11/01/variable-importance-linear-regression/ \"The t scores approach is in direct opposition to the standardized regression coefficients method to variable importance. Using regression coefficients, the idea is that the most important variables have the largest effect sizes. Using t scores (or, equivalently, p -values) the idea is that the most important variables are the ones that most certainly have non-zero effects. This is what Fisher was thinking about when he thought up p -values: he was looking for a continuous measure of evidence against a singular point-null hypothesis. But this exercise is somewhat pointless, because the t scores are the same (after all, the scaling is just a linear transform to the data matrix). And it’s really the t scores that should be used to determine variable importance, because these take into account the uncertainty in the regression coefficients. At least that’s what I think for linear regression. If we have groups of variables that are correlated, or a categorical variable, replace t score with F score.\""
