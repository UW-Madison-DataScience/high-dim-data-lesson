    "We will now split our data into two separate groupings â€” one for fitting or training the model (\"train set\") and another for testing (\"test set\") the model's ability to generalize to data that was excluded during training. The amount of data you exclude for the test set should be large enough that the model can be vetted against a diverse range of samples. A common rule of thumb is to use 3/4 of the data for training, and 1/3 for testing."
