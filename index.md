High dimensional datasets, or tabular data with many features describing each observation of a dataset, are becoming increasingly commonplace in many research domains. How can researchers find patterns and extract insights from such complex and information-rich data? In this workshop, we will explore several tried and true methods that can help data analysts better understand their high-dimensional data, including: principal component analysis, data visualization (t-SNE and PaCMAP), and regularized multivariate regression. As a result of participating in this workshop learners should be able toâ€¦
* Define, identify, give examples of high dimensional datasets
* How to form lower dimensional descriptions/abstractions of the data while retaining/understanding the connections to the higher dimensional complex system.
* Understand how to visualize and explore high-dimensional data; Reflect upon how high dimensional data visualization and analysis can reveal a research story in noisy data.
* Understand the challenges associated with modeling high dimensional data and methods 
* Define and deploy feature selection and regularization techniques (lasso, ridge, and elastic net) to extract insights from high-dimensional regression models

> ## Prerequisites
>
> Learners are expected to have basic Python programming skills (variable assignments, how to create a function, for loops, etc.) and familiarity with the Pandas package. If you need a refresher on Python before taking this workshop, please review the lesson materials from this [Introductory Python Carpentries workshop](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/index.html).
