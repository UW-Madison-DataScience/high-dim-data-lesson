#### 1. Create a folder named, "high-dim" on your Desktop which will store all of the code we generate throughout the workshop

`C:\Users\username\Desktop\high-dim # Windows path`

`/Users/username/Desktop/high-dim # Mac`

`/home/username/Desktop/high-dim # Linux`

#### 2. Download the helper_functions.py script and add it to the high-dim folder you just created.
